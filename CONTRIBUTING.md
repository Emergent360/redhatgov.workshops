## 1 Fork the `redhatgov.workshops` repo

Forking is a simple two-step process.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the <https://github.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.workshops> repo.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

That's it! Now, you have a [fork][git-fork] of the original RedHatGov/redhatgov.github.io repo.

## 2 Create a local clone of your fork

Right now, you have a fork of the `redhatgov.workshops` repo, but you don't have the files in that repo on your computer. Let's create a [clone][git-clone] of your fork locally on your computer.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-username/redhatgov.workshops.git
cd redhatgov.workshops

# Configure git to sync your fork with the original repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.workshops

# Never push to upstream repo
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```

## 3 Verify your [remotes][git-remotes]

To verify the new upstream repo you've specified for your fork, type `git remote -v`. You should see the URL for your fork as `origin`, and the URL for the original repo as `upstream`.

```sh
origin  git@github.com:your-username/redhatgov.workshops.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:your-username/redhatgov.workshops.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.workshops (fetch)
upstream        no_push (push)
```

## 4 Modify your `master`

Get your local `master` [branch][git-branch], up to date:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

Then build your local `master` branch, make changes, etc.

## 5 Keep your `master` in sync

```sh
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

## 6 [Commit][git-commit] your `master`

```sh
git commit
```

Likely you'll go back and edit, build, test, etc.

## 7 [Push][git-push] your `master`

When ready to review (or just to establish an offsite backup of your work), push your branch to your fork on `github.com`:

```sh
git push
```

## 8 Submit a [pull request][pr]

1. Visit your fork at <https://github.com/your-username/redhatgov.workshops.git>
2. Click the `Compare & Pull Request` button next to your `master` branch.

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives. We'll do our best to review and at least comment within 3 business days (often much sooner).

_If you have upstream write access_, please refrain from using the GitHub UI for creating PRs, because GitHub will create the PR branch inside the main repo rather than inside your fork.
